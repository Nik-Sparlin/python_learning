To use Python Interpreter functions, we go into the terminal/command prompt. The interpreter is a program that we can write Python in.

In terminal:
python3
    This will open up Python Interpreter
    If this doesn't work, you need to add Python3 to your Windows path variable (Google it)

Note: This is not a place to develop a program! It is good for testing.
