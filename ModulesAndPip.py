# modules are external Python files that we can import into our current .Python file
# we can use functions and other properties from other files, which can help you save time!
# to do this we use import: import (file name) --keep at top of file
    # print(nameoffile.fuction_name())

# we can get modules from the Python Module Index from the Python website
# they also have pages that guide you through using them!
    # there are built in modules that you can call
    # there are also external modules that are stored in Python program folder
        # external libraries => lib

# you can also find third party modules on the wider internet and install them
# start by looking up useful third party Python modules

# pip is a program/package manager (pre-installed with Python 3) that lets you install modules
# open the terminal/command prompt on the computer
    # check that pip is installed: pip --version
    # pip install (name of module)
    # you can uninstall as well: pop uninstall (name of module)
# third party modules are in lib => site-packages
# then in Python file: import (module name)
