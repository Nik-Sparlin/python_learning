# functions are collections of code that perform specific tasks
# we can call on functions when we need them
# we can also create functions

# this new function will greet the user
# we use def to let Python know we are creating a new function
def say_hello():
    #this is where we define the function
    print("Hello User")

# we then call the function to perform what we want it to do
say_hello()
